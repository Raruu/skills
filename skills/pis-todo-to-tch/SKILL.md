description: "Turn Profile Plus todos (MCP profile-plus) into a formatted Polinema internship log book (DOCX + PDF). Use whenever the user runs /pis-todo-to-tch, or asks to \"buat log book\", \"bikin laporan magang\", \"generate log book\", \"cetak log book\", \"rekap todo jadi log book\", \"log book bulanan\", or wants their Profile Plus todo/attendance data converted into the official LOG BOOK KEGIATAN document. Supports month, month/week, and date-range periods, and outputs to a 'Laporan <Bulan>' folder in the current working directory.

# PIS Todo → TCH (Log Book) — Profile Plus → Log Book DOCX/PDF

Turn the user's Profile Plus activity into the official internship log book document.

The output follows the Polinema template: letterhead header, student info table, a daily table (`Hari, Tanggal | Jam Masuk | Jam Pulang | Kegiatan`), and a signature block. Todos fill the Kegiatan column; attendance fills the Jam Masuk/Pulang columns.

## Invocation

```
/pis-todo-to-tch <periode>, <word|pdf>
/pis-todo-to-tch SETUP
```

Both segments are optional.

| Segment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | Period. Empty = current month (1st → today). |
| 2 | Output format: `word`, `pdf`, or empty = both. |

`SETUP` (case-insensitive, alone) is not a period — it switches to setup mode (see below). If the argument is exactly `SETUP`, jump to **Setup mode** and do not generate any document.

Period formats:

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(empty)* | Current month, 1st → today |
| `September` | September of the current year (past month: full; current month: 1st → today) |
| `September 2026` | Same, explicit year |
| `September/minggu 2` | Calendar week 2 (Mon–Sun), clipped to the month |
| `September/minggu 2->3` | Calendar weeks 2 through 3 |
| `Tanggal 2026-09-01 -> 2026-09-15` | Explicit date range (only this format for dates) |

Examples:

```
/pis-todo-to-tch
/pis-todo-to-tch September
/pis-todo-to-tch September 2026, pdf
/pis-todo-to-tch September/minggu 2->3
/pis-todo-to-tch Tanggal 2026-09-01 -> 2026-09-15, word
/pis-todo-to-tch SETUP
```

## Setup mode (`/pis-todo-to-tch SETUP`)

Bootstraps an empty working folder. **Never generate a document in this mode** — only config, and only after the user answers.

1. Run the environment report from the user's workspace (working directory):
   ```
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build-logbook.py --setup
   ```
   It is read-only (creates nothing) and prints JSON: `cwd`, `config_exists`, `config`, `config_error`, `git` (`repo`/`root`/`ignored`), `python`, `libs` (`docx`/`fpdf`), `fonts.serif_found`, `assets`.

2. Show a short summary: the working folder (confirm it is the intended one), config status, missing libraries, git state.

3. **Config**:
   - `config` present → show the current values, then ask via the question tool which fields to update (multi-select, one option per field plus "semua sudah benar"). If the user picks fields, ask for their new values and rewrite the file. Keep the JSON shape.
   - `config_exists` false or `config_error` set → ask via the question tool for the six fields (`nama`, `nim`, `program_studi`, `mitra_industri`, `dosen_pembimbing`, `pembimbing_lapangan`) — one question per field, using the example values as the offered options where helpful. Then write `.pis-todo-to-tch.json` in the working folder.
   - Always re-run `--setup` afterwards to confirm the file parses and has no missing fields, and report the result.

4. **Git**: if `git.repo` is true and `git.ignored` is false, ask whether to add `.pis-todo-to-tch.json` to `.gitignore` at `git.root`. If the user agrees, append the line (create the file if needed) and confirm with `--setup` that `ignored` is now true. If not a repo, skip.

5. **MCP smoke test**: call `profile-plus_get_todo_history` with `limit: 1`. Report OK or the failure — this is informational, not a blocker.

6. **Final report**: config path, git state, libs, MCP, plus suggested next command (e.g. `/pis-todo-to-tch` for the current month). Do not generate anything.

## Step 1 — Resolve the period

The bundled script does all parsing deterministically. Never compute the period yourself. The script lives next to this file:

```
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build-logbook.py --input "<periode>" --resolve-only
```

It prints JSON with `start`, `end`, `label`, `folder`, and `dates`. On invalid input it exits 1 with an `ERROR:` message — relay that to the user and stop.

Show the resolved period to the user in one line, e.g. `Periode: 1 – 18 September 2026 (14 hari kerja)`.

## Step 2 — Config

Personal data lives in `.pis-todo-to-tch.json` **in the working directory** (the folder where the skill is invoked — the same folder that will receive `Laporan <Bulan>/`):

```json
{
  "nama": "Kamina Botan",
  "nim": "1234567890",
  "program_studi": "D-IV Teknik Informatika",
  "mitra_industri": "PT Hoshino Teknologi Nusantara",
  "dosen_pembimbing": "Kagamihara Nadeshiko",
  "pembimbing_lapangan": "Gotoh Hitori"
}
```

Resolution order:

1. `--config <path>` — explicit, must exist.
2. `<cwd>/.pis-todo-to-tch.json` — the working-directory config.
3. Missing → the script copies `config.example.json` to `<cwd>/.pis-todo-to-tch.json` and exits 2 with `CONFIG_CREATED:`. When that happens: tell the user the config was created, show its contents, and ask them to confirm or edit the values. **Do not generate the document in the same run** — wait until the user says the data is correct, then re-run. If the folder is a git repo, the script also prints a `HINT:` about adding the file to `.gitignore` — relay it.

Always run the script with the user's workspace as the working directory (e.g. pass `workdir` to the bash tool) so the config is read from and created in the right place. There is no parent-directory lookup.

If the user gives their real data in chat, edit the config file for them, then continue.

## Step 3 — Fetch data from MCP

Fetch todos and attendance for the resolved range, then write them to a temp JSON file:

```json
{
  "todos": [{"date": "yyyy-MM-dd", "task": "...", "status": "DONE", "created_at": "..."}],
  "attendance": [{"date": "yyyy-MM-dd", "check_in": "...", "check_out": "...", "status": "HADIR"}]
}
```

- `profile-plus_get_todo_history` — call once per month the range touches (`month`/`year` params; paginate with `page` until all items are collected). Keep only entries whose `date` falls inside the range.
- `profile-plus_get_attendance_history` — one call with `start_date`/`end_date` covering the range (it accepts `yyyy-MM-dd`), paginate if needed.
- Keep the `task`, `date`, `status`, `created_at` fields from todos; keep `date`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status` from attendance.
- Write the file to a temp path (e.g. `/tmp/pis-todo-to-tch-<timestamp>.json`), pass it via `--data`, and delete it afterwards.

If there are no todos and no attendance in the range, say so and stop — do not generate an empty document.

## Step 4 — Generate

```
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build-logbook.py --input "<periode>" --data <temp.json> --outdir "<cwd>" [--format word|pdf]
```

Run this with the user's workspace as the working directory (same as Step 2) — the config is read from there.

The script:

- reads `.pis-todo-to-tch.json` from the working directory,
- fills the DOCX template (placeholders → config values),
- clones one table row per day (Mon–Fri always; Sat/Sun only when that day has data),
- fills Kegiatan with one bullet per todo, duration stripped (`Module -> activity`, keeping the module prefix),
- fills Jam Masuk/Pulang from attendance (`HH:MM`), or `-` when absent,
- writes `Laporan <Bulan> <Tahun>/Log Book <label>.docx` and `.pdf` in the working directory.

It prints JSON with `config`, `files`, `rows`, `overwritten`, `days_without_hours`, and `days_without_activities`. Requirements: Python 3 with `python-docx` and `fpdf2` (for PDF).

## Step 5 — Report

Report per generated file: path, number of day rows, and any warnings:

- days whose jam columns are `-` (no attendance data),
- days with an empty Kegiatan (no todos),
- if `overwritten` is true, say the previous files were replaced.

Example:

```
✅ Laporan September 2026/Log Book September 2026.docx (+ .pdf)
   14 baris hari, 4 halaman PDF
   ⚠️ 7 hari tanpa kegiatan: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 September
```

## Edge cases

- **SETUP with other arguments** (e.g. `/pis-todo-to-tch SETUP, September`) → treat `SETUP` as the mode and ignore the rest; mention it.
- **SETUP when config is already valid** → do not overwrite silently; show values and offer selective updates.
- **SETUP in a non-git folder** → skip the `.gitignore` step entirely.
- **SETUP when libs are missing** → report it in the summary and include the `pip install python-docx fpdf2` hint; still finish the other steps.
- **SETUP when MCP is unreachable** → report the smoke-test failure and continue; the user can fix the MCP config later.
- **Invalid period** → relay the script's `ERROR:` message; suggest a valid format.
- **Config missing in workdir** → the script creates `.pis-todo-to-tch.json` from the example and exits 2; show it to the user and wait for confirmation before generating.
- **Config invalid JSON or missing fields** → the script prints a friendly `ERROR:`; fix the file (or ask the user) before retrying.
- **`--config` points to a missing file** → hard error; never auto-create an explicit config path.
- **Future month/week** → the script rejects it; explain the period has not started.
- **End date in the future** → the script clips it to today and adds a warning; surface it.
- **No Python / missing libs** → `pip install python-docx fpdf2` (or `uv pip install`). If PDF fails, retry with `--format word` and tell the user.
- **Weekend rows** → only appear when there is todo or attendance data on those days.
- **National holidays** → not detected; the day still appears if it is a weekday with attendance data. Mention that holidays can be edited manually in the DOCX.
- **Status-only days** (CUTI/IZIN/SAKIT attendance, no todos) → Kegiatan shows the status label (Cuti/Izin/Sakit).
- **Multiple modules in one day** → all bullets are kept; do not merge or reorder them (ordered by `created_at`).
